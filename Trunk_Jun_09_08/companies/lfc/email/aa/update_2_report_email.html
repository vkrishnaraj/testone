Dear {FIRSTNAME},
<br />
<br />
We have been searching for your lost item for seven days, unfortunately, to no avail.
<br/>
<br/>
We will continue our search for your lost item, and should we find an item matching your item's description, we will send you an e-mail to confirm shipping address and to provide you a link to set up a FedEx account.
<br />
<br />
If we are unable to find any items that match the description of your reported lost item within 30 days of your report, we will send you an e-mail advising you that we were unsuccessful in our search and we will close your report.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
Southwest/AirTran Lost Item Recovery Team
