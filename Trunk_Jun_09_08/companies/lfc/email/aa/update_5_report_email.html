Dear {FIRSTNAME},
<br />
<br />
We're not giving up. It's been three weeks of searching for your missing item, but we're still hopeful we'll locate it soon.
<br/>
<br/>
Our search for your lost item will continue; should we find an item matching your item's description, we will send you an email that guides you through the shipping and payment process.
<br />
<br />
If after 30 days we are unable to find your item, we will send you a final email notifying you that your report is closed.
<br />
<br />
If you have found your item or have additional information to provide, such as serial number, <a href="https://live.lostandfound.aero/client/american/login.do">please click here to update your lost item report</a>.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
