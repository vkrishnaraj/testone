Dear {FIRSTNAME} {LASTNAME},
<br />
<br />
We are happy to tell you that we have located an item that <b>closely matches</b> the description of your reported lost item. 
<br/>
<br/>
You only need to reply to this email, within 45 days from today's date, with the following information to facilitate its return:
<br />
<br />
1) Verify the shipping address for your item.
<br />
<br />
2) Method of payment for the shipping cost. <font size="1"><a href="#bot">(Why do I have to pay?)</a></font>
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>We use FedEx ground to return items and would ask that you supply your 9-digit FedEx account number to pay the shipping fees directly to FedEx.</li>
<ul>
<li>If you do not have a FedEx account, one is easy to get by <a href="http://www.fedex.com/us/oadr/">clicking here.</a><br/> or,</li>
</ul>
<li>If you have a preferred shipper, please give us the company name and your account number and we will do the rest.</li>
</ul>
<br />
After we receive this information, the item will be shipped to your desired address and we will close the report. You will receive a tracking email from your preferred shipper. We cannot hold these items in perpetuity, so if we do not receive a reply within 45 days, the item will be salvaged and the report closed.
<br />
<br />
We would like to thank you for flying Southwest Airlines/AirTran Airways and to invite you to try us again.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
Southwest/AirTran Lost Item Recovery Team

<b><u>Why do I have to pay?</u></b>
<br />
<ul><li>
We are trying to reunite passengers with their lost items that were never checked into our control; these include items that were lost at the airport, left on the aircraft, etc.  We are pretty successful at returning thousands of items annually, but shipping is a cost the airline simply cannot bear in this effort.  We are not charging any kind of fee and there is no revenue for the airline; this is being done simply to reunite you and your lost item.
</li></ul>
