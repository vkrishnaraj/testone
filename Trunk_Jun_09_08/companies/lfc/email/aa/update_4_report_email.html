Dear {FIRSTNAME},
<br />
<br />
We're still searching. It's been two full weeks of hunting, but we're not giving up yet.
<br/>
<br/>
We will continue looking for your lost item for another two weeks. We'll send you an email that guides you through the shipping and payment process should we find one that matches your description.
<br />
<br />
If after 30 days we are unable to find your item, we will send you a final email notifying you that your report is closed.
<br />
<br />
If you have found your item or have additional information to provide, such as serial number, <a href="https://live.lostandfound.aero/client/american/login.do">please click here to update your lost item report</a>.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
