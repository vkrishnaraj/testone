Dear {FIRSTNAME},
<br />
<br />
You've lost something important to you. Which is why we're dedicated to helping you find it. We'll search our inventory of items and email you if we find an article that closely matches your description. You'll see a link in the email which will guide you through the shipping and payment process so that we can reunite you and your item quickly.
<br />
<br />
If you have found your item or have additional information to provide, such as serial number, <a href="https://live.lostandfound.aero/client/american/login.do">please click here to update your lost item report</a>.
<br />
<br />
Over the next 30 days we will be working hard to find your lost item, providing you email updates to share our progress. If after 30 days we have not found your item, we'll email you one final time notifying you that your report is closed.  Although we do not accept liability for lost items, we are committed to reuniting our customers with their lost belongings.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
American Airlines Lost and Found Central
