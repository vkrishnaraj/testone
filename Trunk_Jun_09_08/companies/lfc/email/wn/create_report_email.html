Dear {FIRSTNAME} {LASTNAME},
<br />
<br />
We here at Southwest Airlines would like to thank you for flying with us. We have received your lost item report and we are sorry to learn of your lost item, but we want to assure you we will do all we can to help you find it. Upon receipt of your report, we have already started trying to match your description of the item to found items we have received. In the event we find a possible match, we will send you an email to get final confirmation or to request further information. 
<br />
<br />
During our search for your item, we will send you an interim email assuring you we are still looking and we have not forgotten you. If we do not find your item after thirty days of searching, we will send you an email closing the report. Even though we can not accept responsibility for your lost item, we are committed to trying our best to reunite you with it.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
The Southwest Airlines team
