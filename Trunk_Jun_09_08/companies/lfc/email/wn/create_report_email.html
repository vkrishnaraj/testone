Dear {FIRSTNAME},
<br />
<br />
Thank you for flying with Southwest Airlines/AirTran Airways. We received your lost item report and have begun our search to match your item's description to <i>found</i> items we have received.  In the event we find an item that closely matches the description of your item, we will contact you via email, providing you with a link to our shipping page so that you may be reunited with your item.
<br />
<br />
If within the next few days you need to update your lost item report or have additional information to provide, such as a serial number, please log in and edit your lost item report through the <a href="https://live.lostandfound.aero/client/southwest/login.do">Southwest Airlines</a> or <a href="https://live.lostandfound.aero/client/airtran/login.do">AirTran Airways</a> login page.
<br />
<br />
As a courtesy, we will send you periodic email updates to advise you of the status of our search.   If after 30 days we have not found your item, we will notify you via email that the report is closed.  Pursuant to the Carrier's Contracts of Carriage, we do not accept liability for lost items; however, please rest assured that we do our best to reunite our Customers with their belongings.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
Southwest/AirTran Lost Item Recovery Team
