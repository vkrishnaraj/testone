Dear {FIRSTNAME},
<br />
<br />
Thank you for flying with Southwest Airlines. We received your lost item report and have begun our search to match your item's description to <i>found</i> items we have received.  In the event we find an item that closely matches the description of your item, we will contact you via e-mail to confirm shipping information and to provide you a link to FedEx for quick and easy account set up.
<br />
<br />
If within the next few days you need to update your lost item report or have additional information to provide, such as a serial number, <a href="https://live.lostandfound.aero/client/southwest/login.do">please click here to edit your lost item report.</a> 
<br />
<br />
As a courtesy, we will send you periodic e-mail updates to advise you of the status of our search.   If after 30 days we have not found your item, we will notify you via e-mail that the report is closed.  Pursuant to Southwest Airlines' Contract of Carriage, we do not accept liability for lost items; however, please rest assured that we do our best to reunite our Customers with their belongings.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
