Dear {FIRSTNAME} {LASTNAME},
<br />
<br />
We are happy to tell you that we have located an item that closely matches the description of your reported lost item. We will contact you shortly, via telephone, to determine if in fact we have located your item. Please verify the phone number where we can contact you.  After we verify the item is yours, we will set up shipping to your desired address and we will close the report. Unfortunately, we must pass along the shipping charge to you to help us continue to successfully look for our customer's lost items.
<br />
<br />
We would like to thank you for flying Southwest Airlines and to invite you to try us again.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
The Southwest Airlines team
