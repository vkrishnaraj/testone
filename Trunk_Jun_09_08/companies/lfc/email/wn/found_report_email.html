Dear {FIRSTNAME} {LASTNAME},
<br />
<br />
We are happy to tell you that we have located an item that closely matches the description of your reported lost item. You only need to reply to this email, within 45 days from today's date, with the following information to facilitate its return:
<br />
<br />
1) We ask that you verify the shipping address for your item.
<br />
<br />
2) How you would like to make payment for the shipping costs. <font size="1"><a href="#bot">(Why do I have to pay?)</a></font>
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>We use FedEx ground to return items and would ask that you supply a FedEx account number to pay the shipping fees directly to FedEx.</li>
<ul>
<li>If you do not have a FedEx account, one is easy to get by <a href="http://www.fedex.com/us/oadr/">clicking here.</a><br/> or,</li>
</ul>
<li>If you have a preferred shipper, please give us the company name and your account number and we will do the rest.</li>
</ul>
<br />
After we receive this information, the item will be shipped to your desired address and we will close the report. We can not hold these items in perpetuity, so if we don't receive a reply within 45 days, the item will be salvaged and the report closed.
<br />
<br />
We would like to thank you for flying Southwest Airlines and to invite you to try us again.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />

<b><u>Why do I have to pay?</u></b>
<br />
<ul><li>
We are trying to reunite passengers with their lost items, those that were never checked into our control; those that are lost in the airport, on the aircraft, etc. We are pretty successful, returning thousands of items annually, but Shipping is a cost the airline simply can not bear in this effort. We are not charging any kind of fee and there is no revenue for the airline; this is being done simply to reunite you and your lost item.
</li></ul>
