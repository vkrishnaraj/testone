Dear {FIRSTNAME},
<br />
<br />
We are sorry to report that we have not located any item that closely matches the description of your reported lost item. It is highly unlikely that your item is in our possession after this length of time spent looking for it. To that end, we are closing the report. Although we have not had success in finding your lost item, we want to assure you it was not from a lack of effort. Additionally, we recommend that you close your data plan with your data carrier to protect yourself from unauthorized access.
<br />
<br />
We would like to thank you for flying Southwest Airlines/AirTran Airways and to invite you to try us again.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
Southwest/AirTran Lost Item Recovery Team
