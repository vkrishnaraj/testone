Dear {FIRSTNAME},
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, we have not yet located your missing article.  Please know that we are still diligently searching.
<br />
<br />
Should we find an article closely matching your item's description, we will send you an email requesting confirmation of final shipping address, and to provide you a link to set-up a FedEx account so that we can reunite you with your item.  
<br />
<br/>
If we are unable to find any items that match the description of your reported lost item within 30 days of your report, we will send you an email advising you that our search was unsuccessful and your report will be closed
<br />
<br />
If within the next few days you need to update your lost item report or have additional information to provide, such as a serial number, please log in and edit your lost item report through the <a href="https://live.lostandfound.aero/client/southwest/login.do">Southwest Airlines</a> or <a href="https://live.lostandfound.aero/client/airtran/login.do">AirTran Airways</a> login page.
