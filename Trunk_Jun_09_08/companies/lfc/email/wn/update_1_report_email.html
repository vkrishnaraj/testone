Dear {FIRSTNAME} {LASTNAME},
<br />
<br />
We just wanted to send you a quick email to assure you we are still looking for your lost item. To date we have not been successful, but we are still hopeful.  Should we find an item matching your item's description, you will be contacted and asked for final confirmation and to set up shipping at your convenience and expense.
<br />
<br />
Please be advised that if we do not find any items that match the description of your reported lost item within thirty days of your report, we will send you an email advising you that we were unsuccessful in our search and the report is closed.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
The Southwest Airlines team
