Dear {FIRSTNAME} {LASTNAME},
<br />
<br />
We just wanted to send you another quick email to assure you that for the last seven days we have been looking for your lost item. Even though it has been a week and we haven't yet found a match for your report, we are committed to trying to reunite you and your item. In that you have reported this item missing, our recommendation to you is that you close your data plan with your data carrier to protect yourself from unauthorized access. Should we find an item matching your item's description, you will be contacted and asked for final confirmation and to set up shipping at your convenience and expense.
<br />
<br />
Please be advised that if we do not find any items that match the description of your reported lost item within thirty days of your report, we will send you an email advising you that we were unsuccessful in our search and the report is closed. 
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
The Southwest Airlines team
