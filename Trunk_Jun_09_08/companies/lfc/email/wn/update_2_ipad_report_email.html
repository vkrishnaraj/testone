Dear {FIRSTNAME},
<br />
<br />
We have been searching for your lost item for approximately seven days, unfortunately, to no avail.  While we are still diligently searching, we do recommend you notify your data carrier of your lost item to protect yourself from unauthorized access.
<br />
<br />
We will continue with our search for your lost item, and should we find an item matching your item's description, we will send an e-mail to confirm ownership and request shipping information.  As we previously mentioned, you will be responsible for payment of the shipping expense.
<br />
<br />
If we are unable to find any items that match the description of your reported lost item within 30 days of your report, we will send you an e-mail advising you that we were unsuccessful in our search and we will close the report.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
Southwest Airlines Lost Item Recovery Team
