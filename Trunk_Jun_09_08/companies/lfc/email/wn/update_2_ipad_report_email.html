Dear {FIRSTNAME},
<br />
<br />
We have been searching for your lost item for seven days, unfortunately, to no avail.  While we are still diligently searching, we do recommend you notify your data carrier of your lost item to protect yourself from unauthorized access.
<br />
<br />
We will continue with our search for your lost item, and should we find an item matching your item's description, we will send an email to confirm your shipping address and to provide you with a link to set up a FedEx account.
<br />
<br />
If we are unable to find any items that match the description of your reported lost item within 30 days of your report, we will send you an email advising you that we were unsuccessful in our search and we will close the report.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
Southwest/AirTran Lost Item Recovery Team
