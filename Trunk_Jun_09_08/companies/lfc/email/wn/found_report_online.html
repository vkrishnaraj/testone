Dear {FIRSTNAME} {LASTNAME},
<br />
<br />
We are happy to tell you that we have located an item that closely matches the description of your reported lost item. We have, to the best of our ability, verified that the item matched to your lost report is indeed your item. <br/>
<br/>
You will need to click on this <a href="https://testing.nettracer.aero/client/southwest/shippinglogin.do?reportNum={LOSTID}">link</a> within 45 days and provide the following information:<br />
<br />
1) Verify the shipping address for your item.<br/>
<br/>
2) Choose a Shipping Service Level.<br/>
<br/>
3) Provide payment information. <font size="1"><a href="#bot">(Why do I have to pay?)</a></font><br/>
<br />
After we receive this information, your item will be shipped and you will receive tracking information by e-mail, and we will close the report. We cannot hold these items in perpetuity, so if we do not receive a reply within 45 days, the item will be salvaged and the report closed.<br />
<br />
We would like to thank you for flying Southwest Airlines/AirTran Airways and to invite you to fly with us again.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
<br />
Southwest/AirTran Lost Item Recovery Team<br />

<b><u>Why do I have to pay?</u></b>
<br />
<ul><li>
We are trying to reunite passengers with their lost items that were never checked into our control; these include items that were lost at the airport, left on the aircraft, etc.  We are pretty successful at returning thousands of items annually, but shipping is a cost the airline simply cannot bear in this effort.  We are not charging any kind of fee and there is no revenue for the airline; this is being done simply to reunite you and your lost item.
</li></ul>
