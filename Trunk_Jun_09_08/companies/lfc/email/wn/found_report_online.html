<b><u>Why do I have to pay?</u></b>
<br />
<ul><li>
We are trying to reunite passengers with their lost items that were never checked into our control; these include items that were lost at the airport, left on the aircraft, etc.  We are pretty successful at returning thousands of items annually, but shipping is a cost the airline simply cannot bear in this effort.  We are not charging any kind of fee and there is no revenue for the airline; this is being done simply to reunite you and your lost item.
