Dear {FIRSTNAME},
<br />
<br />
We are happy to tell you that we have located an item that <b>closely matches</b> the description of your reported lost item. 
<br/>
<br/>
You only need to reply to this email, within 45 days from today's date, with the following information to facilitate its return:
<br />
<br />
1) Verify the shipping address for your item.
<br />
<br />
2) Method of payment for the shipping cost. <font size="1"><a href="#bot">(Why do I have to pay?)</a></font>
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>We use FedEx ground to return items and would ask that you supply your 9-digit FedEx account number to pay the shipping fees directly to FedEx.</li>
<ul>
<li>If you do not have a FedEx account, one is easy to get by <a href="http://www.fedex.com/us/oadr/">clicking here.</a><br/> or,</li>
</ul>
<li>If you have a preferred shipper, please give us the company name and your account number and we will do the rest. For UPS accounts, please include the zip code associated with the billing for that account.</li>
</ul>
<br />
After we receive this information, the item will be shipped to your desired address and we will close the report. You will receive a tracking email from your preferred shipper.
<br />
<br />
We cannot hold these items in perpetuity, so if we do not receive a reply within 45 days, the item will be salvaged and the report closed.
<br />
<br />
We are grateful for your business and we hope to welcome you onboard a Delta Air Lines flight again soon.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />

<b><u>Why do I have to pay?</u></b>
<br />
<ul><li>
We’re happy to locate and return items to their owners as a customer service but are not able to absorb the shipping cost.
