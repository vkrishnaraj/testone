Dear {FIRSTNAME},
<br />
<br />
We're still searching. It's been a full week of hunting and we have not been successful, but we're not giving up yet. While we are still diligently searching, we do recommend you notify your data carrier of your lost item to protect yourself from unauthorized access.
<br />
<br />
We will continue looking for your lost item for another week. Should we find an item that matches your description we'll send you an e-mail that guides you through the shipping and payment process.  If we are unable to find your item, we will close your report.
<br />
<br />
If you have found your item or have additional information to provide, such as serial number, <a href="https://live.lostandfound.aero/client/delta/login.do">please click here to update your lost item report</a>.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
Delta Air Lines Lost Item Recovery Team
