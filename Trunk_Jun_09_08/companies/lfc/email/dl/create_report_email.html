Dear {FIRSTNAME},
<br />
<br />
You’ve lost something important to you and we’re dedicated to helping you find it. We’ll search our inventory of items and e-mail you if we find an item that closely matches your description.  In that e-mail you’ll see a link which will guide you through the shipping and payment process so that we can reunite you and your Lost Item quickly.
<br />
<br />
If you have found your item or have additional information to provide, such as serial number, <a href="https://live.lostandfound.aero/client/delta/login.do">please click here to update your lost item report</a>.
<br />
<br />
Over the next two weeks your report will remain open.  We will be working hard to find your lost item and providing you e-mail updates along the way.  If we are unable to find your item, we’ll e-mail you one final time notifying you that your report is closed.  Although we do not accept liability for lost items, we are committed to reuniting our passengers with their lost belongings.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
Delta Air Lines Lost Item Recovery Team
