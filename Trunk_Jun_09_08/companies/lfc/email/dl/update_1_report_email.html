Dear {FIRSTNAME},
<br />
<br />
The search continues. Although we have not yet located your missing item, know that we are still diligently searching for it.
<br />
<br />
Should we find an item that closely matches your item’s description we will send you an e-mail that guides you through the shipping and payment process so that we can reunite you with your lost item.
<br />
<br/>
If after two weeks we are unable to find your item, we will close your report.
<br />
<br />
If you have found your item or have additional information to provide, such as serial number, <a href="https://live.lostandfound.aero/client/delta/login.do">please click here to update your lost item report</a>.
