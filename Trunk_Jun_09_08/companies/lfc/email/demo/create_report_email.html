Dear {FIRSTNAME} {LASTNAME},
<br />
<br />
We received your lost item report and have begun trying to match your item's description to found items we have received.  In the event we find a possible match, we will send you an email to get final confirmation or to request further information.
<br />
<br />
Rest assured that we will work diligently to reunite you with your missing article. If we do not find the item you have described within a few days, we will send you an interim email to provide you with an update. If we are unable to find your item after thirty days of searching, we will send you an email closing the report.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
Lost Item Recovery Team
