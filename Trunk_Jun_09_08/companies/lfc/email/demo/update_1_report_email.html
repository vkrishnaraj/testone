Should we find an article matching your item's description, we will send an e-mail requesting final confirmation in order to set up shipping at your convenience.  You will be responsible for the shipping expense.
<br />
<br />
If we are unable to find any items that match the description of your reported lost item within thirty days of your report, we will send you an email advising you that we were unsuccessful in our search and will close the report.

Sincerely,
