Dear {FIRSTNAME} {LASTNAME},
<br />
<br />
We are happy to tell you that we have located an item that closely matches the description of your reported lost item. We only need to verify some information from you to facilitate its return:
<br />
<br />
1) We ask that you verify the shipping address for your item.
<br />
<br />
2) How you would like to make payment for the shipping costs.
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>We use FedEx ground to return items and would ask that you supply a FedEx account number to pay the shipping fees directly to FedEx.</li>
<ul>
<li>If you do not have a FedEx account, one is easy to get by <a href="http://www.fedex.com/us/oadr/">clicking here.</a><br/> or,</li>
</ul>
<li>If you have a preferred shipper, please give us the company name and your account number and we will do the rest.</li>
</ul>
<br />
After we receive this information, the item will be shipped to your desired address and we will close the report. 
<br />
<br />
We would like to thank you for being a loyal customer.  We hope to see you again soon.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
Lost Item Recovery Team
