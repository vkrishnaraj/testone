Dear {FIRSTNAME} {LASTNAME},
<br />
<br />
We are sending you another quick email to assure you that for the last seven days we have been looking for your lost item, though we have not yet located it.
<br />
<br />
We will continue with our search for your lost item, and should we find an item matching your item's description, we will send an email requesting final confirmation in order to set up shipping at your convenience.  You will be responsible for payment of the shipping expense.
<br />
<br />
If we are unable to find any items that match the description of your reported lost item within thirty days of your report, we will send you an email advising you that we were unsuccessful in our search and will close the report.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
Lost Item Recovery Team
